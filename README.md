<h1 align="center">PONG</h1>
I have developed a two-player Pong game in Python (using the module PyGame) where once a player earns 10 points, they win the game.

</br>

Install pygame using pip:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

<br />
<h2>Running The Game</h2>
1. Open <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a> or a Python IDE (such as <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows">PyCharm</a>) <br />
2. Copy and paste the code into the platform <br />
3. Click on the run code button <br />

<h2>Playing The Game</h2>
1. When the game starts running, a start screen will appear <br />
2. Click the start button <br />
3. Use the W/S keys to move the left paddle and the Up/Down Arrows to move the right arrow <br />
4. Once a player reaches 10 points, an end screen should appear with a restart button <br />
5. Click the restart button to play the game again or the close/exit button on the top right of the window to leave the button
